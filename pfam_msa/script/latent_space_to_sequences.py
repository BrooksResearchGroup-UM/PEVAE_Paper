## p is a numpy array with shape [num_seqs, len_protein, num_aa_type].
## p[i,:,:] represents the sequence converted from the latent space point z[i,:].
## p[i,:,:] represents the probabilities of each amino acid at all positions of the i'th sequence.
## Therefore, each point in the latent space is converted into a distribution of protein sequences.
## This distribution is defined by probabilities of amino acid types at all positions.
## p[i,j,:] is a vector of 21 probablities represent the probablity of 21 amino acid type
## at the j'th position of the i'th sequence, so np.sum(p[i,j,:]) = 1
